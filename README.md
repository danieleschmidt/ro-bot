# This bot is no longer functional.

It was developed as a proof of concept.
At one point it was extensively "tested" and worked well for its purposes.
Gepard Shield could not detect it.
I'll leave the repository public in case anyone wants to have a look at what I did.
The majority of the work was figuring out the memory layout of the client though, in order to read the game's state.
This was accomplished through debuggers and cheat engine.
